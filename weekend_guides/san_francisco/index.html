				Must do things
			</h1>
			<p>
				San Francisco has a lot to offer - between the food and the sights, the options are unlimited. Here are a few things that are a must do:	
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>A. Lands End:</strong> This park on the edge of the city offers amazing views of the Golden Gate Bridge. The rocky shoreline and beaches are amazing spots to snap some photos. Plan to spend a couple of hours hiking and hopefully spotting some whales.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<strong>B. Union Square/Market Street:</strong> Exploring Union Square is a great way to get acquainted with the city's hilly nature and the perfect gateway to exploring Chinatown and Market Street. If you have time, checkout the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>C. The Mission & Dolores Park:</strong> The Mission District is the city's most exuberant neighborhood with some of its newest and hippest restaurants and bars. On a sunny weekend day head to Dolores Park with a beach towel and six pack to enjoy the crowds and sun. Make sure to grab a bite at Tartine Bakery and some ice-cream at Bi-rite Creamery!
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>D. Twin Peaks:</strong> Twin Peaks provides an exhilarating vantage point of the city and bay area. Whether you hike up there or take and Uber like me, it's a great time. Just remember to bring warm clothing.

			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>E. Brenda's French Soul Food ($$) :</strong> The line is often long for a reason. The food is amazing, full of flavours that will leave your mouth watering. The beignets are wonderful balls of joy and the fried chicken is heaven.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<strong>F. Ramen Yamadaya ($$) :</strong> Located in Japantown, Ramen Yamadaya serves the best ramen in the city. The creamy broth is simmered for 20-hours and leaves if full of authentic flavours. The spiciness can be adjusted to your preference.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>G. Nopalito ($$) :</strong> This restaurant serves authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price with great service. The food is definitely Instagrammable and tastes even better than it looks.  
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>H. Yank Sing ($$$) :</strong> Although the prices are steep, the food is worth it. Everything from the rice to the dumpling and vegetables are scrumptious.
				</li>
